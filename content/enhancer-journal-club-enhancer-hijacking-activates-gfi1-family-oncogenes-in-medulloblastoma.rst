I read a neat little paper in Nature just before Christmas about enhancer hijacking,
which I think is a particularly interesting topic. The original paper can be found at:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7510/full/nature13379.html

The abstract is as follows:

    Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant paediatric brain tumour currently treated
    with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, posing a
    considerable burden of toxicity to the developing child. Genomics has
    illuminated the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity of medulloblastoma,
    identifying four distinct molecular subgroups. Group 3 and group 4 subgroup
    medulloblastomas account for most paediatric cases; yet, oncogenic drivers for
    these subtypes remain largely unidentified. Here we describe a series of
    prevalent, highly disparate genomic structural variants, restricted to groups 3
    and 4, resulting in specific and mutually exclusive activation of the growth
    factor independent 1 family proto-oncogenes, GFI1 and GFI1B. Somatic structural
    variants juxtapose GFI1 or GFI1B coding sequences proximal to active enhancer
    elements, including super-enhancers, instigating oncogenic activity. Our
    results, supported by evidence from mouse models, identify GFI1 and GFI1B as
    prominent medulloblastoma oncogenes and implicate ‘enhancer hijacking’ as an
    efficient mechanism driving oncogene activation in a childhood cancer.
